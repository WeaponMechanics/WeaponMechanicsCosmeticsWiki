This is the *WIP* wiki page for the upcoming spigot plugin, `WeaponMechanicsCosmetics`. It is designed
to add cosmetic/visual effects to projectiles, guns, and explosions from WeaponMechanics. The main features are

* Particle Trails
* Muzzle Flash
* Explosion particles
* Particle Shapes
* Timers for Reload


Since this is a premium addon, the code is held in a private repository. No code will be added here.
