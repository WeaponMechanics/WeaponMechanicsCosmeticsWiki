WeaponMechanicsCosmetics is a cosmetic addon to the [WeaponMechanics](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/weaponmechanics-guns-in-minecraft-1-12-2-1-20-2.99913/) plugin. It makes the guns "feel more real" by automatically adding ambient sounds and particles. It also adds visual timers, trails, skins, muzzle flashes, crossbow animations... and much more!

### Getting Started

To install the plugin:

1. Download the latest `WeaponMechanics.jar` and `MechanicsCore.jar` [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/99913/).
2. Download the latest `WeaponMechanicsCosmetics.jar` [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/104539/).
3. Add all 3 `.jar` files into your `YourServer > plugins` folder.
4. Make sure to delete any old versions you may have previously downloaded.
